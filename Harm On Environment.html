<h2> How Do Foreworks Harm The Maltese Environment? </h2>
<p class="what_are_fireworks"> Although significant to the maltese culture, fireworks bring about various negative effects on the environment. This happens due to different reasons however one of the main ones is because of the residue and waste left by people after they have used fireworks. Fireworks produce a wide range of chemicals, including perchlorates, heavy metals like lead and copper, and other hazardous compunds, which end up as debris on land or in the ocean. As this residue has an easy access to the oceans, it can upsett fragile marine habitats in Malta. In particular, perchlorates have the potential to lower ocean oxygen levels due to being water-soluble. This would harm fish, crabs, and other marine species that are vital to the island's economy and fishing industry. Firthermore, mocroplastic particles from firework shells and casings can linger in the ocean for years, endangering marine life that consumes them and eventually making their way upp the food chain, which could have an impact on human health. </p>

  <p class="harm_on_environment_2"> On land, plants, wildlife, nd the general health of the habitat are all at risk from fireworks and their waste products. Fields, parks, and natural reserves in Malta may be littered with tubes, casings, and other non-biodegredable items that are frequently left over after firework displays.The chemicals which are part of the residue seepes into the surrounding soil over time. This will eventually kill the plants and trees where the fireworks were originally launched from. Fireworks also have a negative impact on wildlife since the loud, unexpected noises and bight flashing lights can frighten and stress out animals like birds, dogs, etc. Animals like birds may leave nests, alter their migratory habits, or even fail to breed as a result of frequent firework disturbances that change their natural behaviour. </p>

<p class="what_are_fireworks"> The environment of Malta is particularly susceptible to the cumulative harm brought on by fireworks trash because of its distinctive combination of inland and coastal ecosystems. Although fireworks are frequently praised for their aesthetic value, they have a significant and enduring ecological impact. Fireworks residue lingers in the environment and damages ecosystems that many Maltese communities depend on for recreation, tourism, and a living if adequate cleanup efforts and trash disposal procedures are not followed. </p>
