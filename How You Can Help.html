    <h2> How You Can Help To Keep Our Environment Clean </h2>
    <p class="what_are_fireworks"> Any shells, casings, and debris should be gathered and disposed of properly after
        fireworks have been set off. Plastic, metal, and chemical residues are among examples of this garbage, and if
        left behind, they can all negatively impact the nearby ecosystems. Never leave these esidues on the ground or in
        the open fter the display;instead, deposit them in a safe bag and dispose of them in a rubbish bin. Our stunning
        landscapes which are enjoyed by both us and our visitors are contaminated when firework trash is left behind.
        This includes parks, beaches, and rural areas. We can continue to enjoy Malta's colourful elebrations without
        endangering the land and sea by making sure that all firework debris is gathered and disposed of properly.
        <br>
        <br>
        Furthermore, handling one's own garbage is only one aspect of proper garbage disposal. Even if they are not
        yours, think about picking up and discarding any abandoned firework remnants you see in public areas.
        Maintaining the cleanliness and safety of Malta's public spaces can be greatly improved via teamwork. If left in
        the environment, even minute pieces of firework waste, such as burned-out sparklers or tiny plastic shells, can
        hurt local species and contribute to trash.

                <p>We can help preserve our environment and set an example for others by taking a moment to clear up
                    stray firework remnants when we encounter them. Every little bit helps, particularly when we all
                    join together as a community to save Malta's ecosystems and natural beauty. It's important to
                    remember that when you dispose of firework rubbish, you should put it inside the bin rather than on
                    the ground beside it. Trash placed next to a bin is more likely to be dispersed by animals or blow
                    away in the wind, making the initial cleanup effort pointless. Make sure that all firework waste is
                    safely disposed of in a trash can, whether you're at the beach, a park, or the streets of a
                    community. </p>

                <p>By going above and beyond, we can make sure that the trash is appropriately controlled and processed
                    or disposed of, which lowers pollution and maintains a clean environment. We can all contribute to
                    preserving Malta's natural beauty and encouraging a sustainable celebration style by being mindful
                    of the island's common areas and spending a little more time to handle firework debris. </p>
